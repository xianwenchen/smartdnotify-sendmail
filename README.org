smartdnotify-sendmail is a shell script that sends the error type and error message to an email address.

The error type and the error message are generated automatically by smartd.
The error type is defined by $SMARTD_FAILTYPE.
The error message is defined by $SMARTD_MESSAGE.

The recipient of the email is set in /etc/smartd/smartd.conf.

In the example setting of smartd.conf below, the recipient of error emails is set to root@localhost.
A test email is sent each time smartd is up.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
DEVICESCAN -a -m root@vx84 -M exec /path/to/smartdnotify-sendmail -M test
#+END_SRC
