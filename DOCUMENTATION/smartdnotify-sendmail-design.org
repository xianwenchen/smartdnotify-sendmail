#+title: The Design of smartdnotify-sendmail
#+author: Xianwen Chen

smartdnotify-sendmail is a shell script that sends the error message of smartd to an email address, using /sendmail/.

It is a shell script.

The script from inspired from the /usr/local/bin/smartdnotify example from [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/S.M.A.R.T.]], which used /mail/.

smartdnotify-sendmail starts with a shebang.

#+name: shebang
#+begin_src sh :exports codes :eval no
#!/bin/sh
#+end_src

Use /sendmail/ to email the $SMARTD_MESSAGE to $SMARTD_ADDRESS.
The subject line is the $SMARTD_FAILTYPE.

#+name: sendmail
#+begin_src sh :exports codes :eval no
echo "subject:$SMARTD_FAILTYPE\n\n$SMARTD_MESSAGE" | sendmail -v "$SMARTD_ADDRESS"
#+end_src

Put every piece together.
Tangle it to ../smartdnotify-sendmail.

#+name: pxl
#+begin_src sh :tangle ../smartdnotify-sendmail :exports codes :eval no :noweb yes
<<shebang>>

<<sendmail>>
#+end_src

../smartdnotify-sendmail needs to be executable.
The code below is executed, when this org document is exported, which sets ../smartdnotify-sendmail to be executable.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
chmod +x ../smartdnotify-sendmail
#+END_SRC
